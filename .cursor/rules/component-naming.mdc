Rule: Component Naming and Documentation in components.md

    Page Breakdown into Components:
        Each page should be divided into smaller, reusable components such as Sections, Cards, Widgets, etc.
        Break down the UI logically into components (e.g., Header, Footer, Sidebar, CardItem, UserProfile, etc.).

    Descriptive Component Names:
        Each component should have a descriptive name that clearly defines its purpose on the page (e.g., RightSidebar, ProductCard, UserInfoSection).

    Markdown Documentation:
        All component documentation should be collected and stored in a single file named components.md.
        Page Name should be listed at the top of the documentation whenever new components are added, followed by a list of components used on that page.
        Under each page, list all components used with a description of what the component does.

    Structure in components.md:
        At the top of the file, maintain an overview of Page Names and their corresponding components.
        Each component should be documented with the following information:
            Component Name: A clear, descriptive name.
            Description: A brief description of the component's role or functionality.
